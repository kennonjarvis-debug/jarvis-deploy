**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Version**: 1.0

## Overview

Jarvis is an autonomous AI system that monitors all connected services and takes intelligent actions based on context and content. Each integration operates with its own specialized intelligence to provide seamless automation.

## Core Intelligence Principles

1. **Context-Aware Processing**: Jarvis analyzes content to understand intent and context
2. **Cross-Integration Actions**: Actions from one integration can trigger responses in others
3. **User Preference Learning**: Over time, Jarvis learns user patterns and preferences
4. **Proactive Assistance**: Takes actions before being asked when confidence is high
5. **Safety First**: Always asks for confirmation on irreversible or high-stakes actions

## Intelligent Learning & Adaptation

### Pattern Recognition
- **Communication Style**: Learns how you respond to different types of messages
- **Priority Detection**: Identifies which senders/topics are most important to you
- **Scheduling Preferences**: Learns optimal times for different types of activities
- **Task Patterns**: Recognizes recurring tasks and suggests automation

### Confidence Scoring
Every action Jarvis considers has a confidence score:
- **95-100%**: Auto-execute (e.g., obvious calendar events)
- **70-95%**: Execute with notification (e.g., auto-replies)
- **50-70%**: Suggest action for approval (e.g., complex scheduling)
- **<50%**: Flag for manual review (e.g., ambiguous requests)

### User Feedback Loop
- When you modify an action Jarvis took, it learns from the correction
- When you manually do something Jarvis could have done, it suggests automation
- Explicit thumbs up/down on actions helps refine intelligence

### Data Handling
- All data processed locally when possible
- Encrypted storage for sensitive information
- No data sold or shared with third parties
- User controls what data is monitored
